Pseudo Code:

//Counts the number of elements in an array that are less than x.
//A[1...N], an array with N elements
count_l = 0

for i = 1 to N
    if A[i] < x
        count_l = count_l + 1


//Counts the number of elements in an array that are less than or equal to x.
//A[1...N], an array with N elements
count_leq = 0

for i = 1 to N
    if A[i] <= x
        count_leq = count_leq + 1


//Counts the number of elements in an array that are greater or equal to x.
//A[1...N], an array with N elements
count_geq = 0

for i = 1 to N
    if A[i] >= x
        count_geq = count_geq + 1


//Counts the number of elements in an array that are greater than a given element (A[x])
//A[1...N], an array with N elements
count_e = 0
element = A[x] //Assigns the value of the element x as a variable

for i = 1 to N
    if A[i] > element
        count = count_e + 1
